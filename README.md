### Important RE: Dependencies / PHP versions
If you clone this repo from GitHub, you must run `composer update` or you will be missing the required dependencies, which is most of the plugin.

You can also download zipped builds for each version from: https://github.com/CalderaWP/caldera-metaplate/tree/master/releases and is also [available from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/caldera-metaplate/)

Also this plugin requires PHP 5.3 or later. If you're running anything less than 5.4 you really should upgrade for security and performance reasons.
